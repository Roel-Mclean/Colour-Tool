# Colour Tool

## What is it?

This is a tool to simplify the colour selection process for your next application. 
After selecting your primary colour you will be shown multiple colour palettes based off real colour theory.
Additionally a mock website will be shown to display how the colours would look on a website. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
